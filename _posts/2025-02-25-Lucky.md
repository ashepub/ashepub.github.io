<p>Yin Miao just picked up an angry book from the ruins of the apocalypse, and accidentally entered the book and became an exiled unlucky person. It’s just that there are poor mountains, bad waters and hungry people everywhere, and they also drag a family who are used to the fine clothes, jade, food and grains.</p>

<p>
Fortunately, the system sent an initial mission gift package-a space, but she just planned to develop the village into her own vegetable basket, meat plate, rice bag, and natural disasters and wars came.</p>

<p>Yin Miao cracked…</p>

<p>“Where A Miao goes, I will go.”</p>

<p>Seeing the bright woman who was packing things everywhere and preparing to take her family to escape, Xiao Xuan leaned against the tree and said with a smile.</p>

<p>Refugee Yin Miao hid the food stock that was about to explode at any time, and remembered that the plot mission had already deviate from the 108,000-mile mission, she sighed and asked, “Will you also go to the place where you lost your head?”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll go even more.”</p>

<p>A flicker of anger flashed in Xiao Xuan’s eyes, and this time, no one could move the slightest bit of what he wanted to protect.</p>
